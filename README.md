Many of you know me from various places, but since I'm already writing this, why don't I introduce myself?

1. I'm Creet1724,
2. I'm one of the many developers on this [GitHub](#github) thingy,
3. I play lots of [video games](#video-games),
5. I also make video games (and I'll release [that](https://scppugame.com/), eventually),
6. and I make videos on YouTube, occasionally.

Now that you know 5 things about me, why stop here?

# GitHub!

# Video Games!
Would you believe it? I play video games! Such a surprise!  
I play these games often:
- Counter-Strike 2
- SCP: Secret Laboratory
- Minecraft
- ..and a few more I play once and never play again. 

# That's about it
That's all I have to put here. Why don't you check out some of the stuff I've made?
